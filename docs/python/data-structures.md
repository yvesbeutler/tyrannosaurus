# Data Structures

## Lists

Simply an ordered collection similar to an array, but with additional functionality.

```python
# definition
int_list = [1, 2, 3]
misc_list = [1, "two", 3.0]

new_list = range(5) # [0,1,2,3,4]
x = new_list[0] # 0 (first element)
y = new_list[-1] # 4 (last element)
z = new_list[:3] # first three elements


# default functions
x = [1, 2, 3]
length = len(x) # 3
sum = sum(x) # 6
x.extend([4, 5, 6]) # [1,2,3,4,5,6]
x.append(7) # [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
a, b = [0, 1] # a is 0, b is 1
```
